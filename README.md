# glpd_job_fetcher
A python script using selenium to fetch jobs in Transperfect.

This is a simple script to fetch the first job in the container as soon as is available.
To run the script symply execute it with python: python job_seeker.py
The script requieres selenium which you can get by executing: pip install selenium
also requieres that you have the chromedriver binary in any of your path locations or in the folder that the script is located in; you can get the chromedriver binary here: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
The script will create a folder and store some of the html's, these are for analysis.
